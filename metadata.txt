about=This plugin displays the selected features' WKT,EWKT or JSON representation. It differs from QGIS's Core copy functionality by only extracting the features WKT, rather than the entire record. Simply select a feature, press the button and the WKT, EWKT or JSON represenation will be displayed in a dialog box where you can copy its content for use in creating or updating geometries in SQL statements. Based on the original version for QGIS 2 by Hugo Ledoux at https://github.com/hugoledoux/QGIS-getWKT
